The gold annotation for the TDT official test set is not publicly
distributed. Instead, you can submit your parser output on the file
fi_universal_test-official.conll to the evaluation service at the
address below. The service will compare your parser output against the
gold standard and will give you the scores for a number of standard
metrics. These are to be considered the "official" test set results.

The files fi_universal_devel.conll and fi_universal_test.conll are
obtained by splitting the original development set of TDT into two
equally-sized parts.
